    <h1>The Story of My First Dogs!</h1>
    <img src="images/young-rex.jpg" alt="Young Rex" width = "400px" height= "300px">
    <p>So this is my first dog ever: Rex! Click to see Rascal!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Rex</li>
        <li>Rascal</li>
        <li>Buddy</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So my first two dogs were adopted from the Houston SPCA. I volunteered there for a time and enrolled into their program of fostering dogs who were hurt or had been there too long. My first foster was Rex who became my first pet! Next up I wanted to make sure he always had a friend when I was at work so I fostered another dog and Rascal came into the picture!</p>

    <p>I had them for 5 years and eventually met Buddy! Buddy was a stray just roaming the street. He is a bigger dog and I just wanted to make sure initially he would be sent to a good home. Well, over time he grew on me and has become a part of my family!</p>
